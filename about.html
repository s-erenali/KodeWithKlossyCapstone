        <p><strong>Pomodoro Study Sesh has adopted the Pomodoro Technique
        developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. This technique is used to better one's time managment, using a timer to break down work in intervals. Traditionally, there is 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of break. Repeating this 4 times, a longer break of 45 minutes follows, which completes one full cycle of the Pomodoro Technique.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Using the Pomodoro Technique, Pomodoro Study Sesh hopes to provide the user with a simple, efficient way of working that eliminates distractions. Thank you! Enjoy! <br> -Serena, Maura, Kayla</strong></p>
